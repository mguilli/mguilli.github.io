After wracking my brain considering which theme to use, and what functionality to implement I have decided to finally just use the default Jekyll minima theme settings on my blog and build it out as I progress through my fullstack development curriculum.

So I will be back soon to start adding content that I find useful, and hopefully others will, too!
