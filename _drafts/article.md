title: How Code Golf Helped Me Become a Better Rubyist
categories: insights
---
Ruby Code Golf is an activity that I personally found vastly improved my understanding of the Ruby language structure and syntax, however there are some downsides to participation of which the beginner Rubyist should be aware.

### Background

Code Golf is an activity where one attempts to solve a given coding problem with as few characters as possible. As a competition, it is a race to finish the given task both first, and with the lowest character count. 

In preparing to return to studying full stack development after an 18 month hiatus, I accidentally found myself involved in Ruby Code Golf while trying to brush up on my Ruby syntax. In fact, I did not encounter the term 'Code Golf' until several months after I had been unwittingly doing it. 

While completing the daily challenges on the [CodeSignal]([https://codesignal.com](https://codesignal.com/)) website, I noticed that the user rankings for the solutions to each challenge were based firstly on the number of characters for the given solution, and secondly by the first to complete the solution. So, if I was the second user to complete a challenge in 50 characters, my placement was right behind the first user to complete the challenge in 50 characters, jumping ahead of everyone who completed the challenge in more characters, but in less time than I. This ranking system brought out some competitiveness in me, and lead to my practice of golfing Ruby code.

On [CodeSignal]([https://codesignal.com](https://codesignal.com/)), a daily challenge has a set time during which users can submit solutions. The solutions page for a challenge hides all source code until the challenge timer has run out; however, user rankings and character counts are still visible. 

When solving a challenge, I would first code my own solution, then make revisions to attempt to get as close to the shortest solution as possible. After the challenge ended I would review the highest placing user solutions and spend a great deal of time dissecting other's code to learn how it was put together.
